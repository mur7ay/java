            <h3>Enforcement</h3>
            <p>
                These Terms of Service shall be governed and interpreted pursuant to the laws of the State of Ohio, United States of America, notwithstanding any principles of conflicts of law. All disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service shall be
                finally resolved by arbitration conducted in the English language in Cincinnati, OH, U.S.A. under the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. The parties shall appoint as sole arbitrator a retired judge who
                presided in the State of Virginia. The parties shall bear equally the cost of the arbitration (except that the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the arbitration in
                such an amount as may be determined by the arbitrator). All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we shall be entitled
                to seek injunctive relief, security, or other equitable remedies from federal and state courts located in the State of Virginia or any other court of competent jurisdiction. Under no circumstances shall the arbitrator be authorized to
                award punitive damages, including but not limited to federal or state statutes permitting multiple or punitive damage awards. Any purported award of punitive or multiple damages shall be beyond the arbitrator’s authority, void, and unenforceable.
            </p>

            <h3>Severability</h3>
            <p>
                If any part of these Terms of Service is held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part will be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.
            </p>

            <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
            <p>
                These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter herein. We may, at our sole discretion and without notice, revise these terms at any time by updating this posting.
            </p>

            <h3>For Additional Information</h3>
