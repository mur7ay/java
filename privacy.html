            <hr style="width:80px; margin-bottom: 80px;" />

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                JavaBoxx knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy for the JavaBoxx.com web site (the “Site”). If you have questions
                or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact us at support@javaboxx.com. This privacy policy covers only information that is collected through the Site and does not cover websites to which we link.
            </p>

            <h3>Notice of Information We Collect And How We Use It</h3>
            <p>
                Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make
                your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose. In general, our collection and use of information is as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    JavaBoxx will not sell or disclose your name or email address to third parties without your explicit consent, except as specified in this privacy policy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When you subscribe to JavaBoxx, we will collect personal information such as your name, e-mail address, shipping address and credit card information. We use this information to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. All
                    archived credit card information is maintained in a secure and safe environment as described in this privacy policy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    JavaBoxx automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookies, and the pages you request.
                </li>
                <li>
                    JavaBoxx uses information for the following general purposes: products and services provisioning, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, research, and anonymous reporting. IP addresses are automatically reported by
                    your browser each time you view a web page. Your IP address is stored in JavaBoxx's user registration databases when you register with JavaBoxx. IP addresses may be used for various research purposes, and/or delivering unique functionality
                    to our service.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Information We Collect About Anonymous Visitors</h3>
            <p>
                We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Site. We use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community.
            </p>

            <h3>Log Files</h3>
            <p>
                Like many Web sites, we automatically gather certain information about our Site traffic and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating
                system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information
                about our user base. We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information. We use a third-party tracking service that uses log files and cookies, see below, to track non-personally identifiable information
                about visitors to the Site in the aggregate. This service captures usage and volume statistics.
            </p>

            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. As noted above, we [do not] link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while
                on our site. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by the Site only and does not cover. Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. See “Third Party
                Advertisers.”
            </p>

            <h3>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h3>
            <p>
                We employ a software technology called clear gifs, also referred to as web beacons or web bugs, that help manage content on the Site by tracking what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies,
                and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
                We [do not] tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.
            </p>
